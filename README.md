## Contribute
This translation project is quite different from the others. It is a custom built webapp that allows direct ROM editing, so anyone can help translating texts easily without using any external tools.<br/>
If you are willing to help by identifying and translating texts, [read the instructions here](https://www.marcrobledo.com/king-of-fighters-battle-de-paradise-translation/) and help make this translation a reality!


## To-do list
- identify the missing double-byte japanese characters
- learn how NGP maps work and edit them (mostly for menu graphics and instruction screens)
- improve the tool
- ...translate... a lot!

## Limitations
The game has plenty of free space at the end of the ROM, so there is enough space to enlarge and translate all texts (the tool updates the pointers automatically).

However, the limited space in the small screen is still an issue.<br/>
A variable width font implementation sounds hard due to the little technical information about the console.<br/>
This means, we might need to cut some of the texts in order to make them fit in the screen.
